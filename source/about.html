    <p>
      Software is - and always will be - my passion. It is something I am proud of and I always find myself tinkering
      with a new project, pushing languages to their limits and adding that extra layer of polish or extra optimisation
      to make it just that little bit better than it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a fan of many technologies, languages and frameworks and am a self-confessed TDD-aholic. Everything I do I do
      in the best way I can, never happy with phrases like "she'll be right" or "we'll fix it later" as I strive for the
      impossible: perfection!
    </p>
    <p>Though I know my desire for perfection may be an unobtainable one - after all as
      technology evolves new techniques surface, new ways of thinking rise and fall and what was once the way to go is
      now an anti-pattern - but that doesn't stop me from working hard to get as close as possible (without taking all
      the time in the world).

      I am well-versed in many techniques both IT- and non-IT-related, but below are just a few of the ones I am
      most proud of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Honesty and Trust</strong>: No matter the project, honesty is key to trust and trust is key to success,
        by speaking true and not wasting time mincing words success is well on its way.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>English, not Jargon</strong>: I use simple English to explain solutions and situations so that everyone
        can understand what, why and how instead of burying people in technical nonsense.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Jack-of-all-trades</strong>: Instead of limiting myself to 1 area of expertise, I prefer to be
        proficient in multiple areas; able to take on all manner of projects no matter what the specifics are.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Never Settle for Second Best</strong>: No matter what, your projects always get the best, using only the
        best possible techniques and technologies. Half-done is never allowed!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I give a S#!T</strong>: Your project is my project and is handled with the utmost care. This isn't just
        a job, this is a way of thinking and caring that extends beyond the project to the people involved in it.
      </li>
    </ul>
