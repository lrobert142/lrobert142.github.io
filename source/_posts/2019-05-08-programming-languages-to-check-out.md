I know that a jack-of-all-trades is better than a master of one and love working with all sorts of technologies both
frontend and backend, but below are only a few I am proud to have had the pleasure to work with.

Keep your eyes peeled, I'll be adding to this as I find new and interesting things.

## [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)

> Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development
of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. - Clojure Homepage

There are many reasons why I love Clojure (and ClojureScript, its JS equivalent), like the purity of its functions, its
beautiful syntax, its amazing community, its wonderful tooling and its ability to run on very light hardware, but I think
it can be summarised as follows: **If Heaven was a programming language, this would be it.**

I honestly could go on about Clojure for a long while, but perhaps it's better to move on to...

## [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

> JavaScript... is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. - Wikipedia

JavaScript (JS) is a language I love to work in because it's so quick to change. Every other week there's a new framework,
a new library that does everything everyone else does better, faster, stronger or a new way of thinking that calls into
question everything programmers have been doing for years just "because it works" and while that turns off a lot of people,
I could not be happier to see it!

There's nothing wrong with being wrong, it just means you get more to learn and get closer again to the forbidden fruit
that is perfection which seems to be something experienced quite a lot by...

## [PHP](https://php.net/)

> PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. - PHP Manual

PHP has often gotten quite a bad wrap from the programming community. It's inconsistent, confusing and nobody seems to
agree on what should be the proper approach to using it (OO or functional?) but as it's grown, it has slowly begun
morphing into something more stable, well-defined and much more like a proper, presentable programming language. In fact,
nowadays the biggest problems in PHP I see are [PICNIC errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error).

A lot of my using this is due to my frequent work in WordPress (please wait for me to finish before grabbing your
pitchforks!) but as I've used it its grown on me. Like a wart that its too late to remove because everyone knows you by
it, but one that deep down you know you kinda like anyway.
