## Who I am

Software is - and always will be - my passion. It is something I am proud of and I always find myself tinkering with a new project, pushing languages to their limits and adding that extra layer of polish or extra optimisation to make it just that little bit better than it was before.

I am a fan of many technologies, languages and frameworks and am a self-confessed TDD-aholic. Everything I do I do in the best way I can, never happy with phrases like "she'll be right" or "we'll fix it later" as I strive for the impossible: perfection!

Though I know my desire for perfection may be an unobtainable one - after all as technology evolves new techniques surface, new ways of thinking rise and fall and what was once the way to go is now an anti-pattern - but that doesn't stop me from working hard to get as close as possible (without taking all the time in the world).

## My Skills

I am well-versed in many techniques both IT- and non-IT-related, but below are just a few of the ones I am most proud of:

- **Honesty and Trust**: No matter the project, honesty is key to trust and trust is key to success, by speaking true and not wasting time mincing words success all but certain.
- **English, not Jargon**: I use simple English to explain solutions and situations so that everyone can understand what, why and how instead of burying people in technical nonsense.
- **Jack-of-all-trades**: Instead of limiting myself to 1 area of expertise, I prefer to be proficient in multiple areas; able to take on all manner of projects no matter what the specifics are.
- **Never Settle for Second Best**: No matter what, your projects always get the best, using only the best possible techniques and technologies. Half-done is never allowed!
- **I give a S#!T**: Your project is my project and is handled with the utmost care. This isn't just a job, this is a way of thinking and caring that extends beyond the project to the people involved in it.
